# Land of the Free

## Our Founding Fathers

After the Revolution, the next major project was drafting the Constitution. The Articles of Confederation, the first system of government, was too weak for the economic ambitions of many elites. The Constitution’s framers designed a stronger system—but whose interests did it serve?

### A System Designed to Protect Wealth

- The Electoral College and the Senate were created to ensure that ordinary people wouldn’t have too much influence over government.
- Property requirements for voting ensured that only landowners (primarily white men of means) had political power.
- The Three-Fifths Compromise gave the South disproportionate power by counting enslaved people in congressional representation, ensuring that slaveholders remained dominant.

### Debt, Speculation, and the Hamiltonian System

- After the war, Alexander Hamilton pushed for the federal government to assume state debts and establish a national bank. This benefited wealthy bondholders and speculators while forcing the working class to bear much of the financial burden.
- The Whiskey Rebellion (1794) showed how the new government would protect elite interests. Poor farmers protested an excise tax on whiskey (which disproportionately hurt them), and Washington personally led troops to crush the rebellion.

1. The American Colonies: An Extraction Venture from the Start
   Before the Revolution, the American colonies were an economic project—not a democracy, not a land of freedom, but a resource to be exploited by the British Empire. The colonists were essentially tenants on land that Britain claimed as its own, and they were allowed to stay so long as they enriched the Crown.

Land and Resources Were the Prize

The colonies were settled primarily by joint-stock companies and charters (Virginia Company, Massachusetts Bay Company, etc.), whose goal was profit.
Britain used the colonies for raw materials (tobacco, timber, furs, cotton, sugar) that were shipped back to England.
The colonies were not designed for self-sufficiency or self-rule—only for enriching the British elite.
Labor Was Cheap and Disposable

First, Britain used indentured servants, often poor Europeans tricked into contracts that were barely better than slavery.
As plantations grew, chattel slavery became the dominant labor system, particularly in the South.
Even in the North, where slavery was less common, tenant farmers, fishermen, and artisans were economically trapped in systems that enriched the British aristocracy.
Trade and Taxation Ensured Extraction

The Navigation Acts forced American merchants to trade only with Britain, even when better deals existed elsewhere.
The Currency Acts ensured that colonies remained financially dependent on British banks.
The colonies’ wealth was extracted by design—they were not meant to become powerful or independent. 2. The Revolution: Overthrowing the Old Masters
This context helps explain why the American Revolution happened. The colonists didn’t rebel just because of abstract principles of liberty—they rebelled because they were sick of being exploited.

The Stamp Act and Tea Act: Direct taxes that enraged merchants and landowners because they cut into profits.
The Proclamation of 1763: Prevented land-hungry settlers from expanding westward.
The Quartering Act & Military Rule: The British kept standing armies in the colonies to keep order, treating the colonists like subjects, not citizens.
To many, the Revolution felt like a worker uprising against a corporation—a fight against an empire that treated them like pawns. That’s why the early revolutionary rhetoric was so powerful—it genuinely spoke to people who were tired of being owned.

But while the war was fought by farmers, workers, and artisans, the leadership was overwhelmingly wealthy men with land, businesses, and investments. The question was: once the British were gone, what kind of country would they build?

3. Meet the New Boss, Same as the Old Boss
   The Revolution removed Britain’s hand from America’s pocket—but it didn’t stop the ruling class from finding new ways to extract wealth.

Land Speculation & the Betrayal of Small Farmers

Ordinary soldiers were often paid in land grants, which they had to sell to speculators because they were broke after the war.
Wealthy elites—including many Founding Fathers—bought up massive amounts of land, flipping it for profit while small farmers struggled.
Debt, Banking, and the Financial Elite

The first post-revolutionary government under the Articles of Confederation was weak—but it was perfect for the rich, who could operate with little oversight.
Alexander Hamilton’s plan to centralize federal debt and create a national bank made bondholders and investors rich at the expense of poor farmers and war veterans.
The Whiskey Rebellion (1794) was crushed by George Washington himself, proving that the new government would protect property before protecting the people.
Slavery Survived—and Expanded

The new Constitution protected slavery, ensuring that Southern plantation owners remained in power.
The Three-Fifths Compromise gave the South disproportionate political influence, ensuring that landowners remained in control.
Even "freedom fighters" like Jefferson and Madison continued to profit from slavery. Jefferson spoke of liberty while mortgaging his enslaved people to pay debts. 4. The Constitution: The First Rigged Game
The U.S. Constitution was a revolutionary document—but it was also designed to maintain economic hierarchy.

The Electoral College ensured that wealthy landowners and elites had more political influence than the general population.
The Senate was created to be a firewall against direct democracy, ensuring that only the most “responsible” (i.e., wealthy) citizens had real influence.
Property requirements for voting ensured that the poor and working class remained politically powerless.
The Founders didn’t trust the people—they feared mob rule, but what they really feared was an economic revolution.

But the shame of Jamestown came long before our great founding fathers constructed this one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all. We were meant to be something different. Something better. A republic, not a monarchy. A land where no king, no noble, no tyrant could trample on the rights of the people.

We became free from the tyranny of a crown that saw men as peasants. We built a Constitution that encoded and swore to protect representation, free speech, due process, and the right to defy oppression. We declared to the world that all men are created equal, that government must be accountable to its citizens, and that power should rest in those people.

And in the centuries that followed, we have seen these principles shine. We saw them in the soldiers who bled on battlefields to preserve the Union and end slavery. We saw them in the voices of women and civil rights leaders who fought to gain what their Constitution had long promised. We saw them in the workers who battled against factory lords and sweatshop owners for the dignity of an honest wage. We saw them in every moment where America lived up to its promise—where justice shined a light on the darkness.

But justice, though noble, has never been enough to dismantle our original sin.

The men who signed the Declaration of Independence did so while standing on land seized from others. The Constitution was drafted in rooms where half the men held human beings in bondage. The victories of the Civil War were followed not by justice, but by a new system of control: convict leasing, debt peonage, and racial terror.

The moment enslaved people were declared free, the system that had profited from them found new ways to extract their labor. The Black Codes criminalized everyday life—walking without proof of employment, assembling in groups, looking a white man in the eye. Former slaves were arrested on petty charges, shackled, and leased to the very same landowners who had once held them as property. Prison became the new plantation.

Convict leasing was an open secret, its brutality worse than slavery itself. Landowners had no incentive to keep their leased prisoners alive, and thousands were worked to death in fields, coal mines, and railroads. When that system came under scrutiny, the economy didn’t change—just the branding. Debt peonage, sharecropping, voter suppression, and lynching ensured that Black Americans remained an exploited underclass.

But cracks began to form.

The Great Migration saw millions of Black Americans flee the South, seeking factory jobs, better wages, and a chance to build lives beyond the shadow of the plantations. In the cities, they formed communities, built businesses, elected local leaders. Labor movements grew stronger, and for the first time, workers—Black and white—stood together in the streets, demanding fair wages, safe conditions, and an end to child labor.

The Great Depression should have crushed them, but instead, it forced America to reconsider who the economy should serve. The New Deal rewrote the rules, curbing Wall Street’s excesses, protecting workers, establishing a social safety net. The government put people to work building bridges, roads, and schools. It wasn’t perfect—Southern Democrats made sure Black workers were largely excluded—but it was a glimpse of something different. A system that, for once, served people instead of profit.

Then came the war, and everything changed again.

World War II proved that America could mobilize its economy for more than just the wealthy. The war effort pulled the country out of depression, putting millions to work. Factories roared to life. Union power surged. Women, long shut out of industry, became essential. Black soldiers fought and died for a country that still treated them as second-class citizens—but they came home determined to claim what was owed to them.

The civil rights movement followed. They marched. They sat. They bled. They won.

Jim Crow fell, voting rights were secured, schools were desegregated. The country that had once defined itself by exclusion was forced to reckon with its promises.

And for a moment, it seemed like the machine might break.

But the economy never skipped a beat.

Slavery was made illegal—except as punishment for a crime. That loophole was all the system needed. And when the civil rights movement made it impossible to legally exclude Black Americans from voting, owning property, and building wealth, the solution was simple: turn them into criminals.

The first wave of tough-on-crime policies wasn’t about crime at all—it was about control. Nixon’s domestic policy chief, John Ehrlichman, later admitted as much:

> "We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or Black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and Blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities."

It wasn’t about safety. It was about keeping the right people powerless. With protest leaders in jail, communities destabilized, and entire generations marked as criminals, the backlash became law. Social programs were gutted, police budgets swelled, and prisons became a booming industry. By the 1990s, the "tough-on-crime" consensus was bipartisan.

And what did all this law-and-order hysteria produce? A new labor force.

By 1990, private prisons were a booming industry. Corporations lobbied for harsher sentences, mandatory minimums, and three-strikes laws—not to stop crime, but to keep the cells full. The system didn’t need proof that someone was dangerous. It just needed them arrested.

Today, American prisoners—disproportionately Black and brown—work for as little as 23 cents an hour, producing everything from military gear to McDonald’s uniforms. They farm crops, sew clothes, and build furniture, all for pennies. Even when they leave prison, the punishment isn’t over—parole restrictions, court fees, and felony disenfranchisement keep them locked out of society.

The Virginia Company's plantation never shut down. It just changed masks. It wore the mask of racial superiority, crime fighting, saying no to drugs--whatever it needed to. Racism was a central but non-critical part of the story. This was always about extracting wealth from the land and the people and leveraging American prejudices was just a vehicle for that.

This story of America is one of justice and exploitation; hope and betrayal. Our rights and the power of the vote haven't done enough but they helped. What happens when Americans can't protest or vote?

📌 Sidebar: “Crime is Only Illegal if the Poor Do It”

> The U.S. criminal justice system isn’t designed to stop crime—it’s designed to protect wealth. Petty crime, welfare fraud, and street-level scams are aggressively punished, while large-scale financial fraud, wage theft, and rent-seeking are systematized and protected. The same country that jails people for stealing baby formula allows billionaires to extract trillions in financial scams, real estate speculation, and corporate fraud with barely a slap on the wrist.

> Who gets punished?
> ✔ A homeless person stealing food? Arrested.
> ✔ A landlord evicting tenants for profit while leaving units empty? Perfectly legal.
> ✔ A single mother lying about her address to get her kid into a better school? Felony charges.
> ✔ A bank engaging in mortgage fraud that wipes out thousands of families? Pays a fine, keeps operating.
