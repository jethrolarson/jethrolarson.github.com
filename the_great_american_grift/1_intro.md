# Extraction

_Strip-mining Americans for Fun and Profit_

Our entire lives we’ve been told that America is the land of opportunity, where hard work leads to success and where economic growth benefits everyone. Democrats and Republicans measure their success by the stock market and GDP. Economists claim that 2024 was the best year ever. But as we look around, something doesn’t add up. Wages stagnante. Healthcare costs leave everyone in debt, if they can get it. Rent and groceries drain bank accounts despite working respectable, necessary jobs. Are they lying? Where's the beef?

The non-secret is that this system is working as designed. The money was never supposed to go to you. You're a human resource, a depreciating machine. Your manager--hell, the whole fucking system--is trying to squeeze as much value out of you as possible before you reach your expiration date. After that, you're just a cost to be minimized.

This isn't an accident or a side effect, it's how wealth extraction works. The workforce itself is being strip-mined, a Superfund site in waiting. This has already happened in Puerto Rico—a slice of American planned poverty, where our fragile democracy died early. You'll see soon how what happened there isn’t the exception—it’s the blueprint.

Our system isn’t designed to create wealth and prosperity for regular people. The problem isn't partisan gridlock; it's not book bans; it's not DEI hires in Los Angelas; and it's not the Deep State. The problem is our system is designed for wealth extraction--to bleed value from workers, consumers, and whole nations, funneling it into the hands of the people that get to play Monopoly.

This isn’t about big government vs. small government or left vs. right. It’s about who is playing the game and who is getting played. I hate to break it to you but having 500k in a Roth IRA won't let you pick the top hat.

## GDP Lies

It turns out that it's possible for the economy to be booming while the middle class dwindles and the workers struggle.

## Who is the Freedom for?

(define extraction class here and probably drag them lol)

## About this book

This book isn't pro-socialist or anti-market, it's anti-con. We hope that by learning to recognize the grift we can as a society protect each other from the vampires draining our blood as well as those doing so accidentally.

There’s no need for a conspiracy when greed is enough. The billionaires buying up homes, the corporations privatizing water, the financial speculators turning everything into an asset—they aren’t meeting in secret to plot world domination. They’re simply following the incentives of a system that rewards psychopathic greed. When theft is legal and hoarding is profitable, no coordination is necessary. The grift runs itself.

# Notes and references:

We want to define "grift", "extraction", and "extraction class" here

Throughout the book but especially in the begining I should avoid coming out as overtly anti-capitalist. This will keep the book accessible to a wider audience by sidesteping their anti-socialist indoctrination, and even those with free-market ideals should be able to engage with the critique if it's focused on clearly unethical exploitation. Instead of attacking capitalism directly, I just follow the money and state the facts. All judgement passed should be as obvious and unobjectionable as saying "theft is wrong".
