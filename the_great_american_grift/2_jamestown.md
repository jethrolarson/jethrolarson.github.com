America’s Original Sin
The grift didn’t start with Fannie Mae and the housing bubble, it didn’t start with the industrialists carving up railroads and oil fields, and it didn’t start with Jim Crow robbing Black Americans of generational wealth. No, the great American grift is older than America itself.

The first European feet to step on this land did so with greed in their eyes and victims in their boats. Businessmen, sent by The Virginia Company, sailed from England by investors who heard there was gold, silver, and unclaimed land to seize. Over half of the original settlers were “gentlemen” a polite way of saying they were aristocrats that didn’t work. These men weren’t here to build—they were here to cash in–to send profits back to England, no matter the cost. This group of smooth-skinned exploiters were themselves pawns of the investors back home who cared little for their struggle. If the settlers starved, if they fought endless wars with the Native tribes, if they turned on each other and ate their own dead—that was their problem. The investors back in London were just waiting on their returns.

And all those things actually happened. At first they dug in the Virgina mud for gold as their food supplies dwindled, encroaching on the local Pohatan tribe’s land. The natives traded with them at first, but when it became clear that the settlers were more interested in taking than coexisting, relations soured. By the first winter, seven out of ten settlers were dead. Disease, starvation, and conflict erupted. A man was burned alive for stealing bread. Others resorted to cannibalism. When archaeologists excavated Jamestown centuries later, they found the skull of a fourteen-year-old girl, her bones marked with knife cuts where the flesh had been stripped away.

By the time supply ships arrived, the colony was in ruins, a failed investment propped up only by more desperate men shipped in as replacements. But where others saw disaster, the Virginia Company saw a new angle. If they couldn’t mine gold, they would mine people. The land wasn’t valuable on its own, but with enough unpaid labor, it could be. The colony’s leaders turned to tobacco, transforming it into the first cash crop of the New World. To work the fields, they brought over indentured servants, debt prisoners, and enslaved Africans. The experiment had failed as a gold mine, but as a plantation? It could still be profitable.

The Virginia Company was applying the formula that would define American wealth for centuries to come. Sell the dream of easy riches. Promise opportunity. Use up the labor force. Extract everything of value. Leave the people with nothing. From the tobacco fields of Jamestown to the company towns of the Industrial Revolution, from subprime mortgages to the gig economy, the method hasn’t changed. Today, we don’t send ships full of hopeful investors to die in the wilderness—we send them into the debt economy. We sell predatory loans to workers and when they fail we buy their homes and rent them back to them at a premium. The numbers are bigger, the paperwork is cleaner, and the deaths happen in hospital billing departments instead of on the shores of the James River. But the game is the same.
