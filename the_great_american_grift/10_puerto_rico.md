# Puerto Rico - A Planned Economy

[insert personal story of someone from puerto rico]

The story of Puerto Rico starts with familiar beats. Columbus stumbles onto the island in 1493, and Spain immediately turns it into a plantation. Sugar, coffee, and tobacco are grown by enslaved Africans and the Indigenous Taíno people—raw materials fueling European wealth.

In the 19th century, Puerto Ricans fight for independence. But unlike America, they never get it. Spain abolishes slavery in 1873, but, like in the U.S., that just changes how the exploitation happens. Wealth stays in the hands of landowners, and the freed laborers are left with little more than their chains removed.

In 1898, the United States seizes Puerto Rico from Spain in the Spanish-American War. The island had been pushing for autonomy, but now it's just a sweatshop under new management. The locals who once owned their land under Spanish rule watch as 500,000 acres of arable land are seized by U.S. sugar corporations like United Fruit Company and Central Aguirre. The landowners become tenant farmers on their own land, working for the very corporations that stole it.

Congress sees no need to grant Puerto Ricans statehood or full rights, but in 1917, they’re given U.S. citizenship—not out of generosity, but so they can be drafted into World War I. Nearly 236,000 Puerto Ricans register for the draft, and around 18,000 serve in the war. They are segregated into separate units, often assigned to menial or support roles, their service acknowledged only when bodies were needed on the battlefield. Lieutenant Teófilo Marxuach, a Puerto Rican officer in the U.S. Army, fires the first U.S. shot of World War I when he prevents a German ship from escaping San Juan Bay. Yet, when the war ends, the soldiers return to an island whose economy remains locked in American hands. Trade is restricted exclusively to the U.S., ensuring Puerto Rico remains dependent on American imports, even when cheaper food and goods are available from Latin America. A national-scale version of sharecropping.

The postwar years bring no relief. In 1947, the U.S. launches Operation Bootstrap, promising to modernize Puerto Rico, but modernization is just another word for turning the island into a cheap labor hub for U.S. corporations. Factories move in, offering poverty wages while sending all profits back to the mainland. Puerto Ricans, unable to unionize or demand better conditions, are left with the scraps. At the same time, a new form of eugenics takes root. By 1968, one-third of Puerto Rican women have been sterilized, many without full consent, under the guise of population control. The U.S. military expands its footprint, seizing land for bombing ranges, naval bases, and training grounds. Entire communities are forcibly displaced so that American warplanes can test their payloads.

By the 1980s, Puerto Rico is turned into a corporate tax haven. U.S. companies flood the island, exploiting a special federal tax loophole that lets them operate without paying federal taxes. For a moment, it creates the illusion of prosperity, but in 1996, Congress repeals the tax break. The corporations flee overnight, and Puerto Rico’s economy collapses. To "help," U.S. banks flood the island with predatory loans. By the 2000s, Puerto Rico is drowning in debt. In 2016, Congress passes the PROMESA Act, stripping Puerto Rico of any remaining financial autonomy and placing its economy under direct U.S. control. Austerity measures gut public services, schools shut down, pensions are slashed, and the island becomes a hunting ground for Wall Street investors, who buy up Puerto Rican debt at pennies on the dollar, treating the entire island like a financial asset to be stripped for parts.

Then comes the storm. In 2017, Hurricane Maria levels Puerto Rico. Thousands die, power is out for nearly a year in some areas, and the U.S. government barely responds. Instead of real relief, Wall Street moves in to push even more privatization. Foreign investors buy up land, driving Puerto Ricans out of their own neighborhoods. In 2023, the U.S. privatizes Puerto Rico’s electric grid, and blackouts get worse. The island’s economy, still suffocated by U.S. control, is now being sold as a crypto tax haven.

The latest wave of billionaires and speculators swoop in to avoid capital gains taxes, treating the island as their personal playground while the people who built the island are priced out of their own homes. They call it innovation. They call it a "crypto utopia." Just like the factory lords and sugar barons before them, they promise opportunity, wealth, and progress. But just like before, the wealth isn’t for Puerto Ricans. It’s for the newcomers.

Investors buy up land in historic districts, driving up rents and forcing locals out of their own neighborhoods. Property values soar in places like Dorado and Old San Juan, while wages stay the same. The same government that can’t rebuild schools, hospitals, or a stable power grid has no problem rolling out the red carpet for a new wave of digital prospectors.

First it was sugar. Then it was pharmaceuticals. Then it was Wall Street. Now, it’s crypto.

Every time Puerto Rico had a chance to claw its way out, American lawmakers—of both parties—let it sink. They let the banks own the island. They let corporations strip it for parts. They let its people starve, and when the storms came, they let them drown.

They exploited Puerto Rico because they knew the locals couldn’t mobilize and Americans wouldn’t care. This is the capitalist endgame—when the public looks away and the government helps billionaires "quietly do whatever we want."
