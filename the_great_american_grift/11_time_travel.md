This is a reverse montage, where we walk back through history, seeing the missed chances to stop extraction before it locked in and learning what must be done differently now.

Start at the beginning—Jamestown, the original sin of America.

This wasn’t an accident, it was an old pattern used by the ruling classes for thousands of years, a raiding party.
Land theft, debt servitude, and labor extraction were the first economic engines of America.

Revisiting slavery and Reconstruction

Enslaved people were "freed," but the extraction economy pivoted—convict leasing, sharecropping, Jim Crow.
Reactionaries always pivot the grift when the old system breaks down.
What if land had been redistributed? What if white labor movements had stood with freed Black workers?
Industrialization and the Robber Barons

The rise of capital over labor created extreme wealth gaps.
What if the New Deal had been more radical? (Public banking, worker ownership, breaking up monopolies permanently.)
The grift didn’t die—it rebranded as financial capitalism.
Post-War Boom and the Illusion of Progress

For a moment, we almost built a more equitable system.
But the extraction class never stopped plotting the backlash—Reaganomics, deregulation, globalization.
What if the New Deal had been locked in so it couldn’t be reversed?
Puerto Rico as the U.S.'s Extraction Laboratory

While the mainland middle class was distracted, the U.S. was perfecting the grift abroad.
Debt colonialism, austerity, corporate looting—Puerto Rico shows what happens when extraction is left unchecked.
This wasn’t a one-off. Puerto Rico is what’s coming everywhere if nothing stops it.
The 21st Century: Financialization and Digital Extraction

The modern version of the grift is more hidden, more sanitized—but just as brutal.
Housing, student debt, healthcare—every system is designed for extraction.
The enshittification of tech follows the same pattern—first it serves you, then it serves businesses, then it extracts from everyone.
Where does this cycle end? Or does it?
Arriving in the Present: We Are at the Next Inflection Point

The reader has now walked through every past moment where the grift could have been stopped.
Now, we are at another one.
What’s happening right now that we need to stop?
The next wave of financialized housing?
The privatization of AI, water, and public resources?
The consolidation of billionaire power into permanent oligarchy?
The Final Question: Do We Break the Cycle, or Do We Let It Run Again?

This isn’t about "solving everything"—it’s about recognizing the grift in time to stop the next pivot.
The reader should feel not just informed, but in motion.
What happens next isn’t written yet.
Let’s make a new plan.
