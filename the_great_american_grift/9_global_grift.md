### Hack the Plannet

The Globalization of the Grift

**Purpose:** Show how **nation-states now play the extraction game against each other, not just their own people.**

- **Ukraine mineral rights deal**—America using a war-torn nation to secure **long-term mineral control.**
- **IMF & World Bank debt traps**—Developing nations are forced into debt they **can never escape**, in exchange for foreign ownership of infrastructure.
- **China’s Belt & Road vs. Western Imperialism**—Two different models of **economic control over weaker nations.**
- **The U.S. Military as the enforcer of economic extraction**—why so many wars just **coincidentally benefit U.S. corporate interests.**
- This is really the same play as Jamestown, as Puerto Rico started. This is how collonialism worked, and it didn't end, it's just corpratized.
