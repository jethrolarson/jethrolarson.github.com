## **EXTRACTION: The Great American Grift**

> **The American Dream was never real. It was a con, a pyramid scheme, a temporary illusion that only worked as long as there was fresh wealth to extract.** Now, the bill is due, and the grift is collapsing in real time.

For generations, Americans were told that **hard work leads to prosperity**—that if you played by the rules, you could own a home, build a future, and live a good life. **That was always a lie.** The system wasn’t built for you. It was built to **extract everything from you**—your labor, your wages, your home, your healthcare, your education, your time, your future—while the ruling class rigged the game in their favor.

In **EXTRACTION**, we trace how America **perfected the art of economic plunder**—from the colonial land grabs of Jamestown to the financialization of housing, healthcare, and education. We expose how capitalism evolved from **producing value to pure extraction**, where billionaires thrive by **trapping people in debt, rent, and corporate monopolies.** And we reveal how every supposed **“failure” of the system—student debt, unaffordable housing, medical bankruptcies, wage stagnation—isn’t failure at all. It’s the system working exactly as designed.**

- **How did a nation built on land theft and slavery turn financial fraud into its primary industry?**
- **Why are billionaires richer than ever while the middle class is collapsing?**
- **How did we go from a society that built things to one that just sells debt and suffering?**
- **Why do working people get punished for petty crimes while corporate theft is rewarded?**
- **And most importantly—how do we take the keys back before America becomes just another failed state?**

**This isn’t a book about economic injustice—it’s a manual for seeing through the grift.** If you’re tired of being lied to, tired of watching wealth hoarded while millions struggle, and tired of wondering **why nothing ever seems to change—this book will show you why. And what comes next.**
