### Extraction

Establish the thesis—**extraction, not just wealth inequality, is the real driver of oppression, suffering, and systemic failure.**

- Extraction is not just economic—it’s labor, land, resources, political power, and even culture.
- Every injustice—colonialism, racism, classism, imperialism—**traces back to extraction.**
- **We are still living in an extraction economy.** It’s just become more complex, hidden behind finance, law, and corporate structures.

### \*\*Time-Travel Shenanigans

#### **Purpose:**

The conclusion of the book becomes a chronological walk through the history we covered, revisiting the key moments of extraction and reactionary backlash, now viewed with full context. We look at mistakes and lost ground and posit what action might have been taken to prevent regression and why it didn't happen. We end talking about the current issues in america including the housing crisis, new imperialism, rising fascism, labor movement, the immigration scapegoating, Super-PACs, etc. We end with a question "So what do you want to do about it?"
