User Guide
------------

Here's some tips to get the most out of your handy new Jethro:

* __Share the vision__ - Talk about how the big picture and how the product will change people's lives.

* __Exercise openness__ - Communicate early, often, and trust him.

* __Keep him involved in UX__ - Jethro cares a lot about user experience. It'll save time and deliver better results if you get his input during planning rather than development.

* __Provide a team environment__ - Everything is better when we work together. Lone wolves are lonely wolves.

* __Value flow__ - Work in [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) is more productive than work punctuated by interruptions, slow development workflows, and randomization. Some complex work is practically impossible out of flow. Investing in work to improve development flow will benefit all developers on the team and the work they produce.

* __Have fun__ - Interpersonal relationships are important to Jethro and his performance improves when he feels like he's working with friends.
