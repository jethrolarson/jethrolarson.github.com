Here's some tips to get the most out of your handy new Jethro:

* __Share the vision__ - Talk about how the big picture and how the product will change people's lives. If you get Jethro engaged you'll get Superman instead of Clark Kent.

* __Exercise openness__ - Communicate early, often, and trust him; he will return the favor.

* __Don't hold back__ - If Jethro isn't meeting your expectations, raise the issue as soon as you notice. It might have slipped his mind or he might have assumed that you no longer care about the thing. Don't wait for the right moment when you can address the problem now.

* __Keep him involved in UX__ - Jethro cares a lot about user experience. It'll save time and deliver better results if you get his input during planning rather than development.

* __Put him on a team__ - If working with others is unnecessary for him to accomplish your goals, he'll find new goals. 

* __Value flow__ - Work in [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) is more productive than work punctuated by interruptions, slow development workflows, and randomization. Some complex work is practically impossible out of flow. Investing in work to improve development flow will benefit all developers on the team.

* __Have fun__ - Interpersonal relationships are important to Jethro and his performance improves when he feels like he's working with friends.
