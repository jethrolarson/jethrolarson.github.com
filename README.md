Here's some tips to get the most out of your handy new Jethro:

* __Sell the vision__ - Jethro is an actual person so don't treat him like a tool you can wield at whim. Sell him on the project vision and see what he wants to do. If he believes in the vision he will deliver it better.

* __Communicate customer value__ - Jethro needs to understand the high-level goals and proposed customer value to work effectively. "Cuz the CEO said so" is surprisingly insufficient to get his buy-in. 

* __Exercise openness__ - Jethro doesn't perform well when "handled" or kept in the dark. Communicate early, often, and trust him; he will return the favor.

* __Make expectations and priorities clear__ - If you feed him waffles for breakfast you'll be eating waffles for dinner. Nobody wants old soggy waffles for dinner.

* __Address deficiencies now__ - If Jethro isn't meeting your expectations, raise the issue as soon as you notice. It might have slipped his mind or he might have assumed that you no longer care about the thing. Don't wait for review time or leave his manager feedback when you can address the problem now.

* __Keep him involved in UX__ - Jethro cares a lot about user experience. It'll save time and deliver better results if you get his input during planning rather than development.

* __Put him on a team__ - [Everything is awesome when you're part of a team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y). If working with others is unnecessary for him to accomplish your goals, he'll find new goals. 

* __Value flow__ - Work in [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) can be 2 to 5 times more productive than work that is punctuated by interruptions, slow development workflows, and randomization. Some complex work is practically impossible out of flow. Flow state can also lead to innovations that would not happen otherwise. Investing in work to improve development flow can have similar benefits to all developers on the team.

* __Have fun__ - Interpersonal relationships are important to Jethro and his performance improves when he feels like he's working with friends. He's not always outgoing so make sure to engage him.

* __Keep him rested__ - Jethro will forget to rest when under stress and when overworked his performance and job satisfaction declines. Encourage him to take time off and help him plan for it.
