## What’s really at stake as we dismantle the DOE

In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin the process of [dismantling the U.S. Department of Education](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/improving-education-outcomes-by-empowering-parents-states-and-communities/). The order aims to close the department "to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law" and transfer many of its functions to other agencies.

This includes moving the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio to the Small Business Administration, and shifting special education and school nutrition programs to the Department of Health and Human Services. The order also prioritizes routing federal education dollars to private institutions through school choice programs, and explicitly seeks to defund initiatives that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.

While Congress must approve any formal elimination of the department, the administration has already laid off nearly half its staff. Major lawsuits are now underway, with teachers' unions and civil rights organizations accusing the administration of overstepping its authority. Even some Republican lawmakers—particularly those from rural districts—have raised concerns about the fallout for public schools.

Given this moment, it’s worth taking a sober look at what the Department of Education actually does, and what might be lost if its dismantling continues unchecked.

## What the Department of Education Actually Does

Despite myths and political talking points, the Department of Education is not a curriculum factory or a classroom overlord. It doesn’t write textbooks, mandate what children learn, or control your local school board. Its core responsibilities are structural, protective, and financial.

Here’s what it actually does:

### 1. Distributes Federal Education Funding

The department manages and allocates billions in federal funding, ensuring resources reach the students and schools who need them most:

- **Title I** funding for low-income K–12 schools.
- **IDEA** grants for special education.
- **Pell Grants** for low-income college students.
- Federal **student loan** infrastructure, including FAFSA.

### 2. Enforces Civil Rights Protections

Through the Office for Civil Rights, the department ensures that schools and universities follow federal laws prohibiting discrimination based on race, gender, disability, and other protected categories.

### 3. Collects and Publishes National Education Data

The department runs the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which gathers data on everything from graduation rates to achievement gaps. This data informs policy, supports research, and keeps the public informed.

### 4. Provides Oversight and Guidance

While it can’t dictate local decisions, the department helps schools interpret and implement federal laws like Title IX. It issues guidelines on everything from accessibility to safe learning environments.

### 5. Responds to Crises and Emergencies

During natural disasters or national crises (like COVID-19), the department channels emergency funds, supports displaced students, and helps school systems recover.

### 6. Holds Colleges Accountable

It oversees accreditation standards and student protections in higher ed—especially when it comes to for-profit institutions that have historically taken advantage of vulnerable students.

## What Happens If It Disappears?

If the Department of Education is dismantled, the consequences won’t be abstract—they’ll be immediate and personal for millions of students and families:

- **Federal financial aid could collapse into chaos.** I'm currently helping cover tuition for another parent's child because their Pell Grant disbursement was delayed. Without that help, they might have had to drop out. Most students don’t have a safety net like that. Shifting the infrastructure behind FAFSA, Pell Grants, and federal loans to agencies that aren't built for it could delay or derail critical support—right when tuition comes due.

- **Civil rights protections would weaken—or disappear completely.** In states unwilling to enforce them, students could face unchecked discrimination based on race, gender, disability, and more. Without a federal watchdog, there’s no consistent floor for fairness.

- **Public schools would fall further behind.** Poor and rural districts often rely on federal funding to fill gaps. Without it, already-struggling schools would be left to fend for themselves while wealthy districts surge ahead.

- **We’d lose the data we use to hold the system accountable.** The Department’s national education statistics are foundational to policy, research, and transparency. Without that shared picture, we’d be flying blind.

- **Predatory colleges would have a field day.** With fewer federal regulations and less oversight, for-profit institutions could once again target vulnerable students with scams and false promises—leaving them with debt and worthless degrees.

## This Isn’t Hypothetical for Me

I grew up poor. Without a Pell Grant and FAFSA, I wouldn’t have gone to college. Those programs grant—and the public university system it supported—helped me go from poverty to a comfortable upper-middle-class life. This story isn’t rare. Millions of Americans rely on federal support to build a better future.

Destroying the Department of Education doesn’t just hurt “the bureaucracy.” It hurts real people. It risks throwing away the infrastructure that has helped generations climb out of poverty and into opportunity.

## Let’s Be Honest About What’s Happening

You don’t have to love bureaucracy. You don’t have to agree with everything the Department of Education has done. But dismantling it isn’t about empowering parents or fixing schools—it’s about defunding protections, shifting public money into private hands, and ending federal accountability.

Rather than burning it down maybe we should consider how to improve how it serves America's students.
