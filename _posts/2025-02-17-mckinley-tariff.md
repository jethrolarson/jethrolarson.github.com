In my last post, I talked about [why the 1890s weren’t the golden age]({% post_url 2025-02-17-trump-gilded %}) Trump imagines. Now let’s talk about McKinley himself—specifically his obsession with tariffs and how it backfired on America and the world.

At a recent event, Trump said:
> "our country in the 1890s was probably ... the wealthiest it ever was, because it was a system of tariffs and we had a president, you know, McKinley, right? [...] he was really a very good businessman. ... We were a very wealthy country."

McKinley built his career on pushing tariffs as a silver bullet for economic growth. But just like Trump, he didn’t understand basic economics or global consequences.

## McKinley’s Tariff Flip-Flop: A Policy Bought by His Donors
In 1890, McKinley pushed the McKinley Tariff, a massive 50% tax on imported goods. It was supposed to protect American businesses—but here’s what really happened:

* ❌ Prices skyrocketed for consumers.
* ❌ U.S. exports collapsed as foreign nations retaliated with their own tariffs.
* ❌ Public outrage was immediate, and McKinley’s party got crushed in the 1890 elections.

So what did McKinley do when he actually became president? He reversed course.

His 1897 Dingley Tariff was full of loopholes and special exemptions—not because he learned his lesson, but because his corporate donors needed them. The tariff wasn’t about protecting American workers—it was about protecting the industries that funded McKinley’s campaign.

Sound familiar?

## McKinley’s Tariffs Weren’t Just Bad for America—They Helped Destabilize the World
Historian Sarah Paine describes “Half-Court Tennis” thinking—when a country only focuses on its own actions without thinking about how the rest of the world will react. If you aren't looking across the net and predicting what your opponent is gonna do how well can you play? 

McKinley’s tariff obsession was a textbook example:

* ✅ He jacked up tariffs on foreign goods, thinking it would boost American business.
* ✅ Instead, other countries retaliated with tariffs on U.S. exports, making it harder for American farmers and manufacturers to sell abroad.
* ✅ This pushed struggling economies further into crisis, deepening global instability.
* ✅ The ripple effects helped fuel nationalist and economic tensions that led to long-term global conflicts

This same tariff-first, reaction-later mistake helped push Japan toward economic isolationism and militarism in the 1930s, ultimately contributing to WWII. When you ignore global consequences, you create long-term disasters.

McKinley wasn’t a genius economist—he was a short-sighted politician who set off a chain reaction that hurt America and the world. And now Trump is repeating the same mistakes.

Tariffs Aren’t a Silver Bullet—They’re a Loaded Gun Aimed at the Economy

Trump idolizing McKinley’s tariffs shows he hasn’t learned from history:
✔️ Tariffs aren’t just an American decision—other countries hit back.
✔️ Consumers, not corporations, pay the price when costs rise.
✔️ Long-term economic consequences matter—and ignoring them has led to wars before.

If Trump really wants to be like McKinley, he should at least learn how badly McKinley’s policies failed. But then again, learning from history has never been his strong suit.
