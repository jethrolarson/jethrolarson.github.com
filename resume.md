I've been doing front end web development for more than 10 years. In that time I've used several languages, dozens of libraries and several different framewoks. I've written JavaScript libraries for my teams and open source, written CSS and widget frameworks from scratch viewed by millions of users around the world. I've given talks in front of hundreds of developers. I've evangelized user experience, tutored, and mentored other developers. I've run large and small projects. I've been a JavaScript developer, CSS expert, App Developer, E-ink Developer, Backend Developer, UI Designer, UX Designer, Scrummaster, Project Lead, and Team Lead.
